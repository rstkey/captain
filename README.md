Version control and key management for [Solana](https://solana.com/) programs.

- Automatic versioning of program binaries based on [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo)
- Separation of deployer and authority keys
- Per-cluster configuration
- Reusable and custom program addresses
- _(optional)_ Integration with [Anchor](https://project-serum.github.io/anchor/) IDLs

## Setup

Install via Cargo like so:

```
cargo install --git https://github.com/saber-hq/captain --force
```

Then, in your directory containing your root `Cargo.toml`, run the following command:

```
captain init
```

## Usage

A Captain workflow works like so:

1. Build your latest programs via `captain build`
2. Deploy any new programs with `captain deploy`
3. Upgrade any new programs with `captain upgrade`

### Build

First, build your programs using the command:

```bash
captain build
```

This runs `anchor build -v` if you have Anchor installed, and `cargo build-bpf` if you don't have Anchor installed.
